# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned the time complexity for the different alogrithms present and solved copule of questions on Hackerank.

**Thoughts:**: Just because I didn't pay attention to DSA in college, doesn't mean I can't learn it. Anything is possible if I set my mind to. You got this Shivanjali. Keep Going. Just One Step At a Time.
